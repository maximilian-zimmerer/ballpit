# Ballpit

is a self-initiated project, based around the goal to playfully re-interpret a commonly known organisation method: the Todo-List. My initial idea was to bind the concept of the "Todo" to a visual object, which would accompany each task throughout its lifecycle. Heavily inspired by Google Creative Lab's Activity Bubbles (2020), I decided to implement physical balls that would pile up as the user adds more tasks to a list. The overall design is aimed at being easy to grasp, brutalist, and fun.
